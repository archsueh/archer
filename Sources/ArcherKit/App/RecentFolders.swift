// MARK: - Recent project folders

/// [archer] Ported from iAmCorey/kooky (v0.35, issue #28) — the zero-config
/// answer to "let me re-open my project folders without ⌘O every time".
/// archer just remembers every folder a workspace was opened on. Backs
/// File → Open Recent and the ⌘P recent-folder entries.
///
/// Own JSON file (`recent-folders.json`) rather than a `state.json` field:
/// the list is app-global while `state.json` is written per window on
/// independent debounce timers — separate files mean the two can never
/// race or clobber each other. Same seam as kooky (fileURL injectable for
/// tests); only the App Support path helper differs (archer keeps its
/// private support dir inside `ShellIntegration`, so we compute it here).
